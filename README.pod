=head1 NAME

Tree::Serial - Perl module for deserializing lists of strings into tree-like structures and vice versa

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is a stub.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a stub.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 separator

=head2 degree

The common maximal degree assumed of the tree nodes. It defaults to 2:

    my $ts = Tree::Serial->new({degree => 2});

is the same as 

    my $ts = Tree::Serial->new();

but you can specify any other positive integer.

=head2 traversal

    my $ts = Tree::Serial->new({traversal => 1});

A non-negative integer, indicating where the root is placed in a tree traversal. It defaults to 0, meaning the root comes first, before the subtrees: what is usually called L<pre-order traversal|https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tree-traversals-inorder-preorder-and-postorder/>.

If you've specified a C<k>-ary tree, then setting the C<traversal> attribute to C<k> means you are doing a L<post-order traversal|https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tree-traversals-inorder-preorder-and-postorder/> instead:

    my $ts = Tree::Serial->new({degree => 3, traversal => 3});
